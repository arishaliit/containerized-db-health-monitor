# Containerized Database Health Monitor with CI/CD

This project provides a robust, portable, and automated solution for monitoring the health and performance of a PostgreSQL database. It demonstrates practical usage of containerization, shell scripting, Python programming, and CI/CD practices via GitHub Actions.

---

## Project Goal

Create a self-contained monitoring system that:

- Proactively validates database health  
- Detects operational issues early  
- Supports system stability in production environments

---

## Key Features

- **Containerized Database**  
  Spins up an isolated PostgreSQL instance using Docker Compose for consistent testing and development.

- **Python-Based Health Checks**  
  A Python script (`monitor.py`) performs:
  - Connection verification  
  - Row count checks (e.g., `users` table)  
  - Timestamp check of last log entry  
  - NULL value checks in critical columns

- **Automated Orchestration**  
  `run_monitor.sh`:
  - Starts containers  
  - Waits until DB is healthy  
  - Runs health checks  
  - Shuts down containers cleanly

- **CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)**  
  Automates daily and per-push health checks via `.github/workflows/main.yml`

- **Clear Logging**  
  All results output clearly with success, warning, or error flags

## Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop / Engine**  
  [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)  
  > Enable WSL 2 integration if using Windows

- **Python**  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
  > Add Python to `PATH` during install

- **Git / Git Bash**  
  [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
  > Use Git Bash on Windows for terminal consistency
